### R1D0 26.01.2019
In this day, I read the rules and started a Simple Dashboard APP based by create-react-app for self-development. This application will be show some API information for specific users. I don't choose yet but this will be API from from https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis. In an hour from the start, I made the config of ESLint, install sass and create the router.
